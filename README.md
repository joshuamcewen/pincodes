# AND Challenge #8 - PIN

A secret agent is attempting to gain access to a doorway using a PIN pad which is organised like this:

They observe somebody using the PIN pad on the doorway to gain access, but unfortunately couldn't get a good enough look
at the exact keys which were pressed. The digits were approximately 97516, but each real digit could actually lie on a
horizontally or vertically adjacent digit to the approximate ones. Your task is to use this information to determine a
list of possible PIN codes.

It's also useful to note that some keys on the PIN pad appear to be more worn/used than others. The following array
represents how worn each key looks, from most worn to least: [5,1,2,8,7,4,0,3,6,9]

Rewards:
- 4 points are awarded for determining all possible PIN codes for the example above
- 3 further points are awarded for completing the challenge in a unique choice of language amongst other participants
- 3 further points are awarded for ordering your list of possible PIN numbers by order of likelihood*, given the above 'wear' data
